#MS SQL Dump
This is a simple PowerShell script that lets you create db exports for MS SQL similar to the way you can do with mysqldump and pg_dump.
##Here are a few examples of what you can do with it:
- create text based backup that can be stored in SCC
- examine changes in db with a simple diff tool
- transfer schema and data between production and dev without SQL server complaining about .bak file coming from another version of SQL server
